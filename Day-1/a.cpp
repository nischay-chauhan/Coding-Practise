    Given an array 'balloons' representing the heights of N balloons, 
    the task is to destroy all the balloons with minimum arrows.

    Balloons are destroyed by shooting an arrow horizontally from left to right. 
    The arrow starts at an arbitrary height and decreases by 1 after hitting each balloon.
